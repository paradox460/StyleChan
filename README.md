#### Troubleshooting

- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and StyleChan settings and restarting your browser

- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, StyleChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality

- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/nebukazar/StyleChan/issues) page

- Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/nebukazar/OneeChan/wiki) for instructions
