  "body": "![StyleChan](https://i.imgur.com/W8aFRNP.png) StyleChan\r\n====\r\n\r\nStyleChan is a userscript functioning on top of 4chan X allowing you to customize the site with various themes. \r\n\r\nOriginally developed by [seaweedchan](https://github.com/seaweedchan), this is a fork of the [Oneechan](https://nebukazar.github.com) fork.\r\n\r\n##[Click to Install](https://nebukazar.github.io/StyleChan/builds/StyleChan.user.js)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Install instructions\r\n\r\nInstalling [4chan X](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) is **required** for StyleChan to work.\r\n\r\n- Firefox: Requires the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) addon. Click the Install link above.\r\n\r\n- Chrome: Requires the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl) extension. Click the Install link above. Alternatively you can download a [.crx here](https://nebukazar.github.io/StyleChan/builds/StyleChan.crx) if you are using Chromium or are not using Windows. Drag&drop into the extensions page to install.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and StyleChan settings and restarting your browser\r\n\r\n- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, StyleChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality\r\n\r\n- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/nebukazar/StyleChan/issues) page\r\n\r\n- Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/nebukazar/OneeChan/wiki) for instructions\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Development & Contribution\r\n\r\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/nebukazar/StyleChan/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\n- [Source Code](https://github.com/nebukazar/StyleChan)\r\n- [Reporting Bugs and Contributing](https://github.com/nebukazar/StyleChan/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n",
